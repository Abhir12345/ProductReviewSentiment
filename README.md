# 🧵 Fashion Product Review Sentiment Analyzer

This project uses a fine-tuned DistilBERT model to classify customer reviews of fashion products as **Positive** or **Negative**. The model was trained on real-world e-commerce data and deployed using **Gradio** on Hugging Face Spaces.

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Input**: User enters a raw fashion product review.
2. **Tokenizer**: Converts text to BERT-compatible tokens.
3. **Model**: Predicts sentiment (0 = Negative, 1 = Positive).
4. **Output**: Sentiment label with confidence score.

## 🧪 Example

> _"The dress fits beautifully and the fabric is amazing!"_

**Prediction**: `Positive (97.21%)`
